    "text": "\n\tIntro\n\n\n\n\tIf you follow this, you will be able to:\n\n\n\n\n\t\tcreate an new wallet address and secret key\n\t \n\t\n\t\ttest that you have the correct address and secret key on paper before sending a payment\n\t \n\t\n\t\tactivate wallet\n\t \n\t\n\t\tuse offline signing to make sure your wallet is able to send out before moving all of your intended holdings over to it\n\t \n\t\n\t\tSend XRP from your Cold Wallet without ever entering your secret key on an online computer\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tcreate raw transaction on offline computer\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tsign\u00a0transaction on offline computer\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\teasily move the signed transaction blob over from the offline computer to an online computer using a QR code\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tsubmit signed transaction blob to a\u00a0ripple server\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n \n\n\n\tI haven\u2019t audited the code on @ripplerm\u00a0\u2019s wallet because I do not know how, so trusting it is up to you. \u00a0I think his wallet is great, it is easy to install, pretty easy to use and it has a lot of great options. The QR code for the transaction blob is extremely helpful for offline signing (if you don\u0027t know what i am talking about this is for you).\n\n\n\n\tI did the following on a raspberry pi B+ with raspbian installed via noobs (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/). There is no on-board wifi on this model, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about shutting it off. I bought a 16gb micro sd card just because it was on sale for $8, you can use 8gb without a problem. You can also get them with noobs already installed on amazon if you want to go the raspberry pi route but this will work with whatever computer you use. It\u2019s just up to you to make sure whatever you are using won\u2019t go online again. This is why I think pi\u2019s are perfect, you can take the sd card out and your whole OS is gone. You could also go the linux on a usb stick road but you will have to ask google about that.\n\n\n\n\tThe rest will assume you have both\u00a0an offline computer ready to go and an online computer ready to go, preferably in the same room.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tUseful Links\n\n\n\n\tHosted Wallet\n\n\n\n\tCheck out \u00a0the wallet or practice without downloading anything (don\u0027t use this hosted version for sending any real transactions, i.e. DON\u0027T put your secret key in):\n\n\n\n\thttp://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/\n\n\n\n\tYou can practice by switching network to test (top left).\n\n\n\n\tYou can use this test-net account for practice:\n\n\n\n\tADDRESS :r479Q1f3xm4VfAxNLoXAVKhSN1E8FArztD\n\n\n\n\tSECRET: saUxhRNFjsa9H45VfFeDxSYYRUbhD\n\n\n\n\tIf someone ruins it for everyone else and uses all the XRP, you can generate new test accounts which include 10,000xrp here:\n\n\n\n\thttps://ripple.com/build/ripple-test-net/\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tDownload Wallet\n\n\n\n\tTo download wallet, open below link , click green clone or download, click download zip\n\n\n\n\thttps://github.com/ripplerm/ripple-wallet\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tSetup\n\n\n\n\tFirst download\u00a0the wallet(https://github.com/ripplerm/ripple-wallet). Put the contents of the zip file on a usb stick, bring that stick to your offline computer and drop the folder onto the desktop or somewhere good for you.\n\n\n\n\tThere should be three files in the folder: index.html, package.json, readme.md\n\n\n\n\tOpen index.html, this will open the wallet and you are ready to proceed\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tCreate Wallet Address/Secret Key\n\n\n\n\tFirst you need to create a new wallet address and secret key. Since we already have ripplerm wallet on an offline pc, we will use it.\n\n\n\n\tOpen the wallet and go to the Tools Tab, then within that tab go to the Account-Generator tab(middle one) and click the Random\u00a0button\n\n\n\n\tI am a level lower than noob when it comes to cryptography, but I have read on this forum that the longer you let your computer run before doing this the more entropy (lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder).\n\n\n\n\tAfter clicking Random you will be able to see your secret key (seed/secret -under SEED) which begins with a small \u201cs\u201d and also your wallet address (Address: \u00a0- under ACCOUNT) which begins with a small \u201cr\u201d\n\n\n\n\tWrite your secret key on a piece of paper, underline any CAPITAL letters to help avoid confusion later. Double check each digit one by one.\n\n\n\n\tFollow the same process as above for your Wallet Address but on a separate sheet of paper.\n\n\n\n\tTest that you have written the address and secret key down correctly\n\n\n\n\tWe will now check to see if you wrote them on your paper correctly.\n\n\n\n\tYou should still be on the tools tab, click the RAW TXN tab\n\n\n\n\tFill out the following Fields:\n\n\n\n\t*Account: enter your wallet address here\n\n\n\n\t*Sequence: 1 \u00a0( it is important to enter correct sequence number normally, \u00a0but we are just checking your written info)\n\n\n\n\t*fee: 12 **see above\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tUnder Transaction Types:\n\n\n\n\tChoose the payment tab\n\n\n\n\tFill out the following Fields:\n\n\n\n\t*Destination: enter your wallet address here (you can just copy it from above this time)\n\n\n\n\t*Amount: 1\n\n\n\n\tAs you scroll down you will see a blue button with a \u201csign\u201d label. Hover your mouse cursor over it, you will see the cursor change from an arrow to a blocked hand - it is not available, this is because not all required fields are filled out correctly or they are not filled out at all. In this case we still have to enter the wallet secret key.\n\n\n\n\tRight above the blue \u201csign\u201d button is the SIGNING area, enter your secret key into the \u201csecret:\u201d box\n\n\n\n\tIf you have entered the correct secret, when you move your mouse over the \u201csign\u201d button you will see it lights up and you are able to click it. If you are not able to click the button, it means you entered one of the above entries wrong. First check the easy stuff, then check your secret to your paper and finally your wallet to the paper. \u00a0If all of these match, you probably wrote either the secret or wallet address wrong. Luckily if you click back to the Account- Generator tab they will both still be there so you can see where you went wrong. Once you are able to click the sign button, go ahead and click so you can see what it will look like, \u00a0if you were successful you will see a tx blob and QR code for that blob.\n\n\n\n\tNow that we know you have a your secret and wallet address written correctly, it will be up to you where you store it and how many copies of them you make. You can put your wallet address on your online computer, but never put the secret key on any online computer (this is a cold wallet, just keep it on paper).\n\n\n\n\tActivate your newly create wallet address\n\n\n\n\tKeep your offline computer running, but move to a separate online computer to:\n\n\n\n\tActivate the new\u00a0address you just created by sending \u00a021 XRP to it from another account, you do not need a destination tag.\n\n\n\n\tCheck to see if your address has been credited using either of the following:\n\n\n\n\thttps://bithomp.com/explorer/ or https://charts.ripple.com/#/graph\n\n\n\n\tIf it\u2019s not there I don\u2019t know where you went wrong, up to you to find out (hint exchange accounts take longer for sending, as an example Polo takes about 5 mins during the week and 30 on the weekend).\n\n\n\n\tPreparation for signing tx and sending tx blob\n\n\n\n\tYou should already have the ripplerm wallet on your online pc, open the index.html file so you have the wallet opened and ready for later.\n\n\n\n\tGet on your phone and install a QR code reader app, I don\u2019t have any recommendations, anyone should work.\n\n\n\n\tBefore sending your whole stash over to your cold wallet, lets make absolutely sure that you have the correct info written by sending a small payment out - might be overkill, but you can see how to use offline signing, and you don\u2019t want to have a billion dollars that you can\u2019t get out.\n\n\n\n\tCreate and sign payment on offline computer\n\n\n\n\tGo back to your offline computer.\n\n\n\n\tGo back to the Raw Txn tab under TOOLS\n\n\n\n\tYour address should already be in there if it is not re-enter it.\n\n\n\n\tSequence number: 1 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThis is 1 because this the first tx you have processed for this account, next time it will be 2. If you ever forget where you left off you can put your address\u00a0(do not enter secret) into this wallet on the online computer, and go to the info tab. You will see a \u00a0\u201cNext Sequence:\u201d field which tells you what your sequence should be.\n\n\n\n\tFee: this depends on what the fee is when you are doing this. This is entered in DROPS\u00a0(1XRP = 1,000,000 drops)\n\n\n\n\tYou can see at the top of the wallet screen in the middle next to \u201cServer S1.ripple.com\u201d there is \u201cFee:##\u201d You will need to look at what the wallet on your online computer shows for the fee, as your offline computer will not be updated. If there is a lot of action, you might have to go pretty high, or you can wait for things to calm down. As I am typing this the fee is jumping from 12 up to 8000+, 8000 is equal to 0.008000 XRP. Whatever the fee is at that time is what you will need to put as a minimum, you probably want to go a bit above the current fee, because it will take a few minutes for you to get to submitting it and the fee will most likely change during that time\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tUnder Transaction Types:\n\n\n\n\tChoose the payment tab\n\n\n\n\tFill out the following Fields:\n\n\n\n\t*Destination: enter the address you had originally sent the 21XRP from to activate your new cold wallet, we are going to send a little back\n\n\n\n\t*Amount: 400000 \u00a0(4 hundred thousand)\n\n\n\n\tThis is in drops and equal to 0.4XRP \u00a0(1XRP = 1,000,000 drops). For more info see: https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#specifying-currency-amounts\n\n\n\n\tIn the \u00a0SIGNING area, enter your secret key into the \u201csecret:\u201d box\n\n\n\n\tClick the blue \u201csign\u201d button\n\n\n\n\tBy doing this you are signing the transaction offline. This will generate a blob of text and an QR code representing that text \u00a0which can then be moved to an online computer and submitted safely.\n\n\n\n\tMove signed tx\u00a0blob to online computer\n\n\n\n\tEither Scroll down so only the QR code is showing and your secret key is no longer visible on the screen, or just clear out the secret field so it is empty (you don\u0027t want to take a picture of it by accident).\n\n\n\n\tGet out your phone and open the QR code app, scan the code, it should convert it back into your tx blob. Copy the blob, email it to yourself or use any other method you can think of to get that blob from your phone to your online computer without having to manually key it in (I\u00a0use google keep).\n\n\n\n\t**EDIT: or as @ripplerm\u00a0mentions below (much easier) \u00a0you can simply submit the signed-transaction with the mobile-phone... via\u00a0https://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/\n\n\n\n\tOnce you have the blob on your online computer, go to the Tools tab and the Submit tab below.\n\n\n\n\tPaste the blob you created into the tx_blob box, and hit submit.\n\n\n\n\tCheck the address you are sending to, to verify that you received the 0.4 XRP. If it is there you are good to go, you can proceed to sending the rest of your XRP \u00a0over to your cold wallet as you were able to receive into and send out of it and know you have the correct key and address info written down.\n\n\n\n\tWhy is this safe?\n\n\n\n\tI had questioned why is this blob is safe to send, and how could it be accepted by a rippleD server without exposing my secret key, I assumed it was some kind of encryption magic but @mDuo13\u00a0 help me understand with the following :\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tActually the blob itself isn\u0027t encrypted or hashed. It\u0027s easy (well, relatively speaking) to take a binary transaction blob and turn it back into a JSON format with transaction instructions and a signature.\n\n\n\n\tBut don\u0027t worry. The real answer to your original question is that a \"signed\" transaction doesn\u0027t have your secret, just your signature. It\u0027s the power of digital signatures! The basic idea of digital signatures uses the same principle as hashes and other cryptography, that some calculations are easy to do but hard to reverse. In the case signatures, you use your secret key and a message to create a signature. Anyone with your public key and a message (which is also attached to the signed transaction) can verify that the signature is legit and it\u0027s for the exact message in question, but they can\u0027t figure out what your secret key is or make signatures for any other, even slightly different, message. In this case, the transaction instructions are the message.\n\n\n\n\tSo \"offline\" signing is less a question of whether you\u0027re actually \"online\" or \"offline\" when you make the signature; it\u0027s a matter of who does the calculations to create the signature. \"Online\" signing means giving your secret to a rippled server (probably hosted on someone else\u0027s computer) so it can calculate the signature for you; \"offline\" signing means doing the signature yourself without sending your secret to another computer. In either case, the resulting signature can only be used once. The problem with online signing is that if you send someone your secret, they (or anyone who intercepted the message with your secret in it) could remember it and use it to create new signatures for any message/transaction they want.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tHopefully this helps someone, if you see any errors please let me know so i can fix them\n\n",

            "text": "\n\tIntro\n\n\n\n\tIf you follow this, you will be able to:\n\n\n\n\n\t\tcreate an new wallet address and secret key\n\t \n\t\n\t\ttest that you have the correct address and secret key on paper before sending a payment\n\t \n\t\n\t\tactivate wallet\n\t \n\t\n\t\tuse offline signing to make sure your wallet is able to send out before moving all of your intended holdings over to it\n\t \n\t\n\t\tSend XRP from your Cold Wallet without ever entering your secret key on an online computer\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tcreate raw transaction on offline computer\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tsign\u00a0transaction on offline computer\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\teasily move the signed transaction blob over from the offline computer to an online computer using a QR code\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tsubmit signed transaction blob to a\u00a0ripple server\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n \n\n\n\tI haven\u2019t audited the code on @ripplerm\u00a0\u2019s wallet because I do not know how, so trusting it is up to you. \u00a0I think his wallet is great, it is easy to install, pretty easy to use and it has a lot of great options. The QR code for the transaction blob is extremely helpful for offline signing (if you don\u0027t know what i am talking about this is for you).\n\n\n\n\tI did the following on a raspberry pi B+ with raspbian installed via noobs (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/). There is no on-board wifi on this model, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about shutting it off. I bought a 16gb micro sd card just because it was on sale for $8, you can use 8gb without a problem. You can also get them with noobs already installed on amazon if you want to go the raspberry pi route but this will work with whatever computer you use. It\u2019s just up to you to make sure whatever you are using won\u2019t go online again. This is why I think pi\u2019s are perfect, you can take the sd card out and your whole OS is gone. You could also go the linux on a usb stick road but you will have to ask google about that.\n\n\n\n\tThe rest will assume you have both\u00a0an offline computer ready to go and an online computer ready to go, preferably in the same room.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tUseful Links\n\n\n\n\tHosted Wallet\n\n\n\n\tCheck out \u00a0the wallet or practice without downloading anything (don\u0027t use this hosted version for sending any real transactions, i.e. DON\u0027T put your secret key in):\n\n\n\n\thttp://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/\n\n\n\n\tYou can practice by switching network to test (top left).\n\n\n\n\tYou can use this test-net account for practice:\n\n\n\n\tADDRESS :r479Q1f3xm4VfAxNLoXAVKhSN1E8FArztD\n\n\n\n\tSECRET: saUxhRNFjsa9H45VfFeDxSYYRUbhD\n\n\n\n\tIf someone ruins it for everyone else and uses all the XRP, you can generate new test accounts which include 10,000xrp here:\n\n\n\n\thttps://ripple.com/build/ripple-test-net/\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tDownload Wallet\n\n\n\n\tTo download wallet, open below link , click green clone or download, click download zip\n\n\n\n\thttps://github.com/ripplerm/ripple-wallet\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tSetup\n\n\n\n\tFirst download\u00a0the wallet(https://github.com/ripplerm/ripple-wallet). Put the contents of the zip file on a usb stick, bring that stick to your offline computer and drop the folder onto the desktop or somewhere good for you.\n\n\n\n\tThere should be three files in the folder: index.html, package.json, readme.md\n\n\n\n\tOpen index.html, this will open the wallet and you are ready to proceed\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tCreate Wallet Address/Secret Key\n\n\n\n\tFirst you need to create a new wallet address and secret key. Since we already have ripplerm wallet on an offline pc, we will use it.\n\n\n\n\tOpen the wallet and go to the Tools Tab, then within that tab go to the Account-Generator tab(middle one) and click the Random\u00a0button\n\n\n\n\tI am a level lower than noob when it comes to cryptography, but I have read on this forum that the longer you let your computer run before doing this the more entropy (lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder).\n\n\n\n\tAfter clicking Random you will be able to see your secret key (seed/secret -under SEED) which begins with a small \u201cs\u201d and also your wallet address (Address: \u00a0- under ACCOUNT) which begins with a small \u201cr\u201d\n\n\n\n\tWrite your secret key on a piece of paper, underline any CAPITAL letters to help avoid confusion later. Double check each digit one by one.\n\n\n\n\tFollow the same process as above for your Wallet Address but on a separate sheet of paper.\n\n\n\n\tTest that you have written the address and secret key down correctly\n\n\n\n\tWe will now check to see if you wrote them on your paper correctly.\n\n\n\n\tYou should still be on the tools tab, click the RAW TXN tab\n\n\n\n\tFill out the following Fields:\n\n\n\n\t*Account: enter your wallet address here\n\n\n\n\t*Sequence: 1 \u00a0( it is important to enter correct sequence number normally, \u00a0but we are just checking your written info)\n\n\n\n\t*fee: 12 **see above\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tUnder Transaction Types:\n\n\n\n\tChoose the payment tab\n\n\n\n\tFill out the following Fields:\n\n\n\n\t*Destination: enter your wallet address here (you can just copy it from above this time)\n\n\n\n\t*Amount: 1\n\n\n\n\tAs you scroll down you will see a blue button with a \u201csign\u201d label. Hover your mouse cursor over it, you will see the cursor change from an arrow to a blocked hand - it is not available, this is because not all required fields are filled out correctly or they are not filled out at all. In this case we still have to enter the wallet secret key.\n\n\n\n\tRight above the blue \u201csign\u201d button is the SIGNING area, enter your secret key into the \u201csecret:\u201d box\n\n\n\n\tIf you have entered the correct secret, when you move your mouse over the \u201csign\u201d button you will see it lights up and you are able to click it. If you are not able to click the button, it means you entered one of the above entries wrong. First check the easy stuff, then check your secret to your paper and finally your wallet to the paper. \u00a0If all of these match, you probably wrote either the secret or wallet address wrong. Luckily if you click back to the Account- Generator tab they will both still be there so you can see where you went wrong. Once you are able to click the sign button, go ahead and click so you can see what it will look like, \u00a0if you were successful you will see a tx blob and QR code for that blob.\n\n\n\n\tNow that we know you have a your secret and wallet address written correctly, it will be up to you where you store it and how many copies of them you make. You can put your wallet address on your online computer, but never put the secret key on any online computer (this is a cold wallet, just keep it on paper).\n\n\n\n\tActivate your newly create wallet address\n\n\n\n\tKeep your offline computer running, but move to a separate online computer to:\n\n\n\n\tActivate the new\u00a0address you just created by sending \u00a021 XRP to it from another account, you do not need a destination tag.\n\n\n\n\tCheck to see if your address has been credited using either of the following:\n\n\n\n\thttps://bithomp.com/explorer/ or https://charts.ripple.com/#/graph\n\n\n\n\tIf it\u2019s not there I don\u2019t know where you went wrong, up to you to find out (hint exchange accounts take longer for sending, as an example Polo takes about 5 mins during the week and 30 on the weekend).\n\n\n\n\tPreparation for signing tx and sending tx blob\n\n\n\n\tYou should already have the ripplerm wallet on your online pc, open the index.html file so you have the wallet opened and ready for later.\n\n\n\n\tGet on your phone and install a QR code reader app, I don\u2019t have any recommendations, anyone should work.\n\n\n\n\tBefore sending your whole stash over to your cold wallet, lets make absolutely sure that you have the correct info written by sending a small payment out - might be overkill, but you can see how to use offline signing, and you don\u2019t want to have a billion dollars that you can\u2019t get out.\n\n\n\n\tCreate and sign payment on offline computer\n\n\n\n\tGo back to your offline computer.\n\n\n\n\tGo back to the Raw Txn tab under TOOLS\n\n\n\n\tYour address should already be in there if it is not re-enter it.\n\n\n\n\tSequence number: 1 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThis is 1 because this the first tx you have processed for this account, next time it will be 2. If you ever forget where you left off you can put your address\u00a0(do not enter secret) into this wallet on the online computer, and go to the info tab. You will see a \u00a0\u201cNext Sequence:\u201d field which tells you what your sequence should be.\n\n\n\n\tFee: this depends on what the fee is when you are doing this. This is entered in DROPS\u00a0(1XRP = 1,000,000 drops)\n\n\n\n\tYou can see at the top of the wallet screen in the middle next to \u201cServer S1.ripple.com\u201d there is \u201cFee:##\u201d You will need to look at what the wallet on your online computer shows for the fee, as your offline computer will not be updated. If there is a lot of action, you might have to go pretty high, or you can wait for things to calm down. As I am typing this the fee is jumping from 12 up to 8000+, 8000 is equal to 0.008000 XRP. Whatever the fee is at that time is what you will need to put as a minimum, you probably want to go a bit above the current fee, because it will take a few minutes for you to get to submitting it and the fee will most likely change during that time\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tUnder Transaction Types:\n\n\n\n\tChoose the payment tab\n\n\n\n\tFill out the following Fields:\n\n\n\n\t*Destination: enter the address you had originally sent the 21XRP from to activate your new cold wallet, we are going to send a little back\n\n\n\n\t*Amount: 400000 \u00a0(4 hundred thousand)\n\n\n\n\tThis is in drops and equal to 0.4XRP \u00a0(1XRP = 1,000,000 drops). For more info see: https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#specifying-currency-amounts\n\n\n\n\tIn the \u00a0SIGNING area, enter your secret key into the \u201csecret:\u201d box\n\n\n\n\tClick the blue \u201csign\u201d button\n\n\n\n\tBy doing this you are signing the transaction offline. This will generate a blob of text and an QR code representing that text \u00a0which can then be moved to an online computer and submitted safely.\n\n\n\n\tMove signed tx\u00a0blob to online computer\n\n\n\n\tEither Scroll down so only the QR code is showing and your secret key is no longer visible on the screen, or just clear out the secret field so it is empty (you don\u0027t want to take a picture of it by accident).\n\n\n\n\tGet out your phone and open the QR code app, scan the code, it should convert it back into your tx blob.

I realized that I actually need a web server in order to read the wallet correctly(most of it is on html) like my fellow noticed few posts before.(I\u0027m using\u00a0Raspbian)\n\n\n\n\tLuckily I found a quick and\u00a0offline\u00a0\u00a0solution for this problem:\n\n\n\n\t1) In the command line, go to the top directory of the wallet (e.g /home/pi/ripplermIsHere/)\n\n\n\n\t2)write : python3 -m http.server \u00a0\u0026lt;port(OPTIONAL)\u0026gt;\u00a0 \u00a0 ---- An http server will be created on this directory. Notice: if you won\u0027t define a port so the deafult one will be\u00a08000\n\n\n\n\t3)Find your \u00a0rpi\u0027s ip (open new command line window and write \u0027ifconfig\u0027)\n\n\n\n\t4) Open Chromium and just write at the address : http://\u0026lt;your ip\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;8000/\u0026lt;chosen port\u0026gt; \u00a0 \u00a0e.g http://1.2.3.4:8000\n\n\n\n\tThis procedure should take 2 minutes and you can run ripplerm on your rpi2 offline without need for any connection to the web.\n\n",

	<strong><u>Intro</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	If you follow this, you will be able to:
</p>

<ul><li>
		create an new wallet address and secret key
	</li>
	<li>
		test that you have the correct address and secret key on paper before sending a payment
	</li>
	<li>
		activate wallet
	</li>
	<li>
		use offline signing to make sure your wallet is able to send out before moving all of your intended holdings over to it
	</li>
	<li>
		Send XRP from your Cold Wallet without ever entering your secret key on an online computer&nbsp;
		<ul><li>
				create raw transaction on offline computer
			</li>
			<li>
				sign&nbsp;transaction on offline computer
			</li>
			<li>
				easily move the signed transaction blob over from the offline computer to an online computer using a QR code
			</li>
			<li>
				submit signed transaction blob to a&nbsp;ripple server
			</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul><p>
	I haven’t audited the code on <a data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.xrpchat.com/profile/145-ripplerm/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="145" href="https://www.xrpchat.com/profile/145-ripplerm/" rel="" contenteditable="false">@ripplerm</a>&nbsp;’s
 wallet because I do not know how, so trusting it is up to you. &nbsp;I 
think his wallet is great, it is easy to install, pretty easy to use and
 it has a lot of great options. The QR code for the transaction blob is 
extremely helpful for offline signing (if you don't know what i am 
talking about this is for you).
</p>

<p>
	I did the following on a raspberry pi B+ with raspbian installed via noobs (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/</a>).
 There is no on-board wifi on this model, so I didn’t have to worry 
about shutting it off. I bought a 16gb micro sd card just because it was
 on sale for $8, you can use 8gb without a problem. You can also get 
them with noobs already installed on amazon if you want to go the 
raspberry pi route but this will work with whatever computer you use. 
It’s just up to you to <strong>make sure whatever you are using won’t go online again</strong>.
 This is why I think pi’s are perfect, you can take the sd card out and 
your whole OS is gone. You could also go the linux on a usb stick road 
but you will have to ask google about that.
</p>

<p>
	The rest will assume you have both&nbsp;an offline computer ready to go
 and an online computer ready to go, preferably in the same room.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Hosted Wallet</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Check out &nbsp;the wallet or practice without downloading anything 
(don't use this hosted version for sending any real transactions, i.e. <strong>DON'T</strong> put your secret key in):
</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/" rel="external nofollow">http://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/</a>
</p>

<p>
	You can practice by switching network to test (top left).
</p>

<p>
	You can use this test-net account for practice:
</p>

<p>
	ADDRESS :r479Q1f3xm4VfAxNLoXAVKhSN1E8FArztD
</p>

<p>
	SECRET: saUxhRNFjsa9H45VfFeDxSYYRUbhD
</p>

<p>
	If someone ruins it for everyone else and uses all the XRP, you can generate new test accounts which include 10,000xrp here:

</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Setup</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	First download&nbsp;the wallet(<a href="https://github.com/ripplerm/ripple-wallet" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/ripplerm/ripple-wallet</a>).
 Put the contents of the zip file on a usb stick, bring that stick to 
your offline computer and drop the folder onto the desktop or somewhere 
good for you.
</p>

<p>
	There should be three files in the folder: index.html, package.json, readme.md
</p>

<p>
	Open index.html, this will open the wallet and you are ready to proceed
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Create Wallet Address/Secret Key</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	First you need to create a new wallet address and secret key. Since we 
already have ripplerm wallet on an offline pc, we will use it.
</p>

<p>
	Open the wallet and go to the <u>Tools</u> Tab, then within that tab go to the <u>Account-Generator</u> tab(middle one) and click the <u>Random</u>&nbsp;button
</p>

<p>
	I am a level lower than noob when it comes to cryptography, but I have 
read on this forum that the longer you let your computer run before 
doing this the more entropy (lack of order or predictability; gradual 
decline into disorder).
</p>

<p>
	After clicking <u>Random</u> you will be able to see your secret key (<u>seed/secret</u> -under <u>SEED</u>) which begins with a small “s” and also your wallet address (<u>Address:</u> &nbsp;- under <u>ACCOUNT</u>) which begins with a small “r”
</p>

<p>
	Write your secret key on a piece of paper, underline any CAPITAL 
letters to help avoid confusion later. Double check each digit one by 
one.
</p>

<p>
	Follow the same process as above for your Wallet Address but on a separate sheet of paper.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Test that you have written the address and secret key down correctly</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	We will now check to see if you wrote them on your paper correctly.
</p>

<p>
	You should still be on the <u>tools</u> tab, click the <u>RAW TXN</u> tab
</p>

<p>
	Fill out the following Fields:
</p>

<p>
	*<u>Account:</u> enter your wallet address here
</p>

<p>
	*<u>Sequence:</u> 1 &nbsp;( it is important to enter correct sequence number normally, &nbsp;but we are just checking your written info)
</p>

<p>
	*<u>fee: </u>12 **see above
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Under <u>Transaction Types:</u>
</p>

<p>
	Choose the <u>payment tab</u>
</p>

<p>
	Fill out the following Fields:
</p>

<p>
	*<u>Destination:</u> enter your wallet address here (you can just copy it from above this time)
</p>

<p>
	*<u>Amount:</u> 1
</p>

<p>
	As you scroll down you will see a blue button with a “<u>sign</u>” 
label. Hover your mouse cursor over it, you will see the cursor change 
from an arrow to a blocked hand - it is not available, this is because 
not all required fields are filled out correctly or they are not filled 
out at all. In this case we still have to enter the wallet secret key.
</p>

<p>
	Right above the blue “<u>sign</u>” button is the <u>SIGNING</u> area, enter your secret key into the “<u>secret:</u>” box
</p>

<p>
	If you have entered the correct secret, when you move your mouse over the “<u>sign</u>”
 button you will see it lights up and you are able to click it. If you 
are not able to click the button, it means you entered one of the above 
entries wrong. First check the easy stuff, then check your secret to 
your paper and finally your wallet to the paper. &nbsp;If all of these 
match, you probably wrote either the secret or wallet address wrong. 
Luckily if you click back to the <u>Account- Generator</u> tab they will both still be there so you can see where you went wrong. Once you are able to click the <u>sign</u>
 button, go ahead and click so you can see what it will look like, 
&nbsp;if you were successful you will see a tx blob and QR code for that
 blob.
</p>

<p>
	Now that we know you have a your secret and wallet address written 
correctly, it will be up to you where you store it and how many copies 
of them you make. You can put your wallet address on your online 
computer, but <strong>never put the secret key on any online computer (<u>this is a cold wallet, just keep it on paper</u>).</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>Activate your newly create wallet address</strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	Keep your offline computer running, but move to a separate online computer to:
</p>

<p>
	Activate the new&nbsp;address you just created by sending &nbsp;21 XRP 
to it from another account, you do not need a destination tag.
</p>

<p>
	Check to see if your address has been credited using either of the following:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://bithomp.com/explorer/" rel="external nofollow">https://bithomp.com/explorer/</a> or <a href="https://charts.ripple.com/#/graph" rel="external nofollow">https://charts.ripple.com/#/graph</a>
</p>

<p>
	If it’s not there I don’t know where you went wrong, up to you to find 
out (hint exchange accounts take longer for sending, as an example Polo 
takes about 5 mins during the week and 30 on the weekend).
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Preparation for signing tx and sending tx blob</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	You should already have the ripplerm wallet on your online pc, open the <u>index.html</u> file so you have the wallet opened and ready for later.
</p>

<p>
	Get on your phone and install a QR code reader app, I don’t have any recommendations, anyone should work.
</p>

<p>
	Before sending your whole stash over to your cold wallet, lets make 
absolutely sure that you have the correct info written by sending a 
small payment out - might be overkill, but you can see how to use 
offline signing, and you don’t want to have a billion dollars that you 
can’t get out.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Create and sign payment on offline computer</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Go back to your offline computer.
</p>

<p>
	Go back to the <u>Raw Txn</u> tab under <u>TOOLS</u>
</p>

<p>
	Your <u>address</u> should already be in there if it is not re-enter it.
</p>

<p>
	<u>Sequence number: </u>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<em>This is 1 because this the first tx you have processed for this 
account, next time it will be 2. If you ever forget where you left off 
you can put your <u>address</u>&nbsp;(do not enter secret) into this wallet on the online computer, and go to the <u>info</u> tab. You will see a &nbsp;“<u>Next Sequence:</u>” field which tells you what your sequence should be.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<u>Fee:</u> this depends on what the fee is when you are doing this. This is entered in DROPS&nbsp;(1XRP = 1,000,000 drops)
</p>

<p>
	<em>You can see at the top of the wallet screen in the middle next to “<u>Server S1.ripple.com”</u> there is “<u>Fee:##</u>”
 You will need to look at what the wallet on your online computer shows 
for the fee, as your offline computer will not be updated. If there is a
 lot of action, you might have to go pretty high, or you can wait for 
things to calm down. As I am typing this the fee is jumping from 12 up 
to 8000+, 8000 is equal to 0.008000 XRP. Whatever the fee is at that 
time is what you will need to put as a minimum, you probably want to go a
 bit above the current fee, because it will take a few minutes for you 
to get to submitting it and the fee will most likely change during that 
time</em>
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Under <u>Transaction Types</u>:
</p>

<p>
	Choose the <u>payment</u> tab
</p>

<p>
	Fill out the following Fields:
</p>

<p>
	*<u>Destination:</u> enter the address you had originally sent the 21XRP from to activate your new cold wallet, we are going to send a little back
</p>

<p>
	*<u>Amount:</u> 400000 &nbsp;(4 hundred thousand)
</p>

<p>
	This is in drops and equal to 0.4XRP &nbsp;(1XRP = 1,000,000 drops). For more info see: <a href="https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#specifying-currency-amounts" rel="external nofollow">https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#specifying-currency-amounts</a>
</p>

<p>
	In the &nbsp;<u>SIGNING</u> area, enter your secret key into the “<u>secret:</u>” box
</p>

<p>
	Click the blue “<u>sign</u>” button
</p>

<p>
	By doing this you are signing the transaction offline. This will 
generate a blob of text and an QR code representing that text 
&nbsp;which can then be moved to an online computer and submitted 
safely.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Move signed tx&nbsp;blob to online computer</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Either Scroll down so only the QR code is showing and your secret key 
is no longer visible on the screen, or just clear out the secret field 
so it is empty (you don't want to take a picture of it by accident).
</p>

<p>
	Get out your phone and open the QR code app, scan the code, it should 
convert it back into your tx blob. Copy the blob, email it to yourself 
or use any other method you can think of to get that blob from your 
phone to your online computer without having to manually key it in 
(I&nbsp;use google keep).
</p>

<p>
	**EDIT: or as @ripplerm&nbsp;mentions below (much easier) &nbsp;you can
 simply submit the signed-transaction with the mobile-phone... via&nbsp;<a href="https://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/" rel="external nofollow" style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">https://ripplerm.github.io/ripple-wallet/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Once you have the blob on your <u>online</u> computer, go to the <u>Tools</u> tab and the <u>Submit</u> tab below.
</p>

<p>
	Paste the blob you created into the <u>tx_blob box</u>, and hit <u>submit</u>.
</p>

<p>
	Check the address you are sending to, to verify that you received the 
0.4 XRP. If it is there you are good to go, you can proceed to sending 
the rest of your XRP &nbsp;over to your cold wallet as you were able to 
receive into and send out of it and know you have the correct key and 
address info written down.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Why is this safe?</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	I had questioned why is this blob is safe to send, and how could it be 
accepted by a rippleD server without exposing my secret key, I assumed 
it was some kind of encryption magic but <a data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.xrpchat.com/profile/130-mduo13/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="130" href="https://www.xrpchat.com/profile/130-mduo13/" rel="" contenteditable="false">@mDuo13</a>&nbsp; help me understand with the following :
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<em>Actually the blob itself isn't encrypted or hashed. It's easy 
(well, relatively speaking) to take a binary transaction blob and turn 
it back into a JSON format with transaction instructions and a 
signature.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>But don't worry. The real answer to your original question is that a
 "signed" transaction doesn't have your secret, just your signature. 
It's the power of digital signatures! The basic idea of digital 
signatures uses the same principle as hashes and other cryptography, 
that some calculations are easy to do but hard to reverse. In the case 
signatures, you use your secret key and a message to create a signature.
 Anyone with your public key and a message (which is also attached to 
the signed transaction) can verify that the signature is legit and it's 
for the exact message in question, but they can't figure out what your 
secret key is or make signatures for any other, even slightly different,
 message. In this case, the transaction instructions are the message.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>So "offline" signing is less a question of whether you're actually 
"online" or "offline" when you make the signature; it's a matter of who 
does the calculations to create the signature. "Online" signing means 
giving your secret to a rippled server (probably hosted on someone 
else's computer) so it can calculate the signature for you; "offline" 
signing means doing the signature yourself without sending your secret 
to another computer. In either case, the resulting signature can only be
 used once. The problem with online signing is that if you send someone 
your secret, they (or anyone who intercepted the message with your 
secret in it) could remember it and use it to create new signatures for 
any message/transaction they want.</em>
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Hopefully this helps someone, if you see any errors please let me know so i can fix them

	Hi,
</p>

<p>
	I created a new account using a random seed + account number XXXX. Now 
the secret seed doesn't change although the public/private keys and 
address change.
</p>

<p>
	After the account is activated, when I try to sign a payment 
transaction with the (unchanged) secret seed and submit the transaction I
 get: tefBAD_AUTH_MASTER: Auth for unclaimed account needs correct 
master key.
</p>

<p>
	why ?
</p>

			<strong><u>Setup</u></strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			First download&nbsp;the wallet(<a href="https://github.com/ripplerm/ripple-wallet" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/ripplerm/ripple-wallet</a>) , also get a copy of firefox (<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/</a>)
 in case the default browser on your setup doesn't play nice. Put the 
contents of the zip file and firefox on a usb stick, bring that stick to
 your offline computer and drop the folder onto the desktop or somewhere
 good for you.
		</p>

		<p>
			There should be three files in the folder: index.html, package.json, readme.md
		</p>

		<p>
			Open index.html, this will open the wallet and you are ready to proceed

	I install&nbsp;the firefox from mozilla on my rpi2 and it gives me an 
error when I try to run it.&nbsp;After some googling I realized that the
 problem is due to the fact that the firefox&nbsp;I downloaded isn't 
compiled for ARM processor, I searced but&nbsp;I didn't &nbsp;find a 
suitable version.&nbsp; How did you overcome this problem?(sorry for the
 newbie question)

	I tried to install Firefox because Chromium didn't behave well. after 
trying to install it for 2-3 hours I decided to try different approach 
and "fix" Chromium . I realized that I actually need a web server in 
order to read the wallet correctly(most of it is on html) like my fellow
 noticed few posts before.(I'm using&nbsp;<strong>Raspbian</strong>)
</p>

<p>
	Luckily I found a quick and&nbsp;<strong>offline</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;solution for this problem:
</p>

<p>
	1) In the command line, go to the top directory of the wallet (e.g /home/pi/ripplermIsHere/)
</p>

<p>
	2)write : python3 -m http.server &nbsp;&lt;port(OPTIONAL)&gt;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; ---- An http server will be created on this directory. Notice: if
 you won't define a port so the deafult one will be&nbsp;<strong>8000</strong>
</p>

<p>
	3)Find your &nbsp;rpi's ip (open new command line window and write 'ifconfig')
</p>

<p>
	4) Open Chromium and just write at the address : http://&lt;your ip&gt;:&lt;8000/&lt;chosen port&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;e.g <a href="http://1.2.3.4:8000/" rel="external nofollow">http://1.2.3.4:8000</a>
</p>

<p>
	This procedure should take 2 minutes and you can run ripplerm on your rpi2 offline without need for any connection to the web.
</p>
