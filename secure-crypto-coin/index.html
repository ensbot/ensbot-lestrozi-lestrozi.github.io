<h2>Goal</h2>
Store multiple cryptocurrencies safely.</p>

<h2>Tenets</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Loaded gun principle: Every computer is compromised and trying to steal cryptocoins</li>
  <li>Those coins should be recoverable 5 years from now (ie, the solution can't rely on some software or site that may not exist anymore)</li>
  <li>Transactions should be done securely (without ever exposing private keys)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>You should know that convenience is the enemy of security: Pretty much every time you try to make something more convenient, it gets less secure.</p>
<p>Doing everything described here will not be convenient. Making a transaction will take about 15 minutes of work, which is way less convenient (and much more secure) than as it would be using a cryptocoin exchange.</p>
<p>But if your use-case is similar to mine - to use this as a <strong>savings account</strong>, and not as a checkings account - you should be fine.</p>
<p>Oh, setting everything up will be a pain also. It should probably take around 3 hours. But you only need to do it once.</p>

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>[henceforth called <em>air-gapped device</em>] A computer that you will NEVER connect to the internet AGAIN*. It needs to come with a webcam or you need to install an external one. It can be a raspberry pi <font class="todo">[UNTESTED]</font>. I strongly encourage you to use it with a Debian-based Linux OS. I see many people recommending <a href="https://tails.boum.org/" class="external">Tails <font class="todo">[UNTESTED]</font></a></li>
  <li>A 8+ GBs pendrive [This will have your bootable USB live OS] - After you install your distro, <b>ONLY</b> plug this pendrive on your air-gapped device.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>More on the loaded gun principle</h2>
<p>I'm going to assume that the every computer you use (even the air-gapped one) is compromised (maybe by a BIOS malware?), is recording everything you do (screen, keys, camera, etc.) and is actively trying to transmit it via network if it gets a network connection (cable or wifi) or copy it to a hidden area on pendrives you plug into that device.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, don't forget these evil hackers are doing this right now! They are watching you read this! So keep that in mind and act accordingly.</p>
<p>More paranoid people can assume that it's also trying to save it to an internal storage (HDD/SSD) or even transmit it using low/high-frequency sound via your speaker! If you are that kind of person, go ahead and remove your HDD/SSD and block your speaker somehow.</p>


<h2>Weakest links</h2>
<p>There are 3 critical attacks that could compromise your security:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generating entropy</li>
  <li>Converting entropy to a "writable" password</li>
  <li>Using this password to generate addresses</li>
</ol>
<p>If you use a bad entropy generator (for instance, a compromised computer with a biased pseudo-random number generator) your key won't be as safe as it could. Think it this way: let's say I make a "random" number generator that only uses numbers 1 to 5; or use a predictable way to generate pseudo-random numbers. You might think you're safe but with that information a hacker may be able to break your key in 1 hour instead of 100,000 years.
<p>Now let's say you got a really good source of entropy. But you don't want your key to be <b>m0zbsw-RYR?,*""m*{mSv.8ZgD;+@W</b>, right? You could easily mistake a "0" for an "O", or an "l" for a "1", or miswrite, or misread.</p>
<p>Following that tutorial you will learn to generate a password like <b>supply-initial-index-copper-can-long-few-enemy-try-submit-reduce-judge-camp-wing-two-sand-spread-dance-cost-food-assume-fat-cash</b> instead, which is way easier to write and less prone to mistakes. And it will provide 237 bits of entropy + the entropy your own password (which can easily have 20 bits of entropy). Even with "only" the 237 bits of entropy, the odds of someone finding your password is 1 in 10^71, which means that it would take longer than the age of the universe to find it even making trillions of guesses per second.</p>
<p>But then, if I give you a software in which you type your really good random number in and it spits out this writable password, how can you know I'm not using only 20 bits of entropy from your random number when generating the words, which would make them way less secure than expected?</p>
<p>The way I will propose you do here won't have these weak links, and is the reason I'm sticking to <a href="bip32/bip32.html">BIP32</a> instead of <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki" class="external">BIP39</a>.
<p>Finally, we need to use this password to generate addresses for multiple cryptocurrencies. This will be done using <a href="bip32/bip32.html">BIP32</a>, which is actually our weakest link of trust. You can try to confirm it's generating the "correct" keys by comparing multiple implementations of it (obviously, do not use your real password when doing so). Other than that, unfortunatelly <font class="todo">I don't have many ideas on how to do this in a less trusting way.</font></p>
<p><img src="xkcd-security.png"></p>

<h2>Let's begin</h2>
<h5>Boot your OS</h5>
<p>First, you need to have a bootable pendrive with Linux. <a href="https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html" class="external">Click here</a> to follow Tails tutorial or <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD" class="external">here</a> for Ubuntu. If you have another preference, go with it.
Mark this pendrive somehow (sticky, nail polisher, etc.) so you know it can only be used on your air-gapped device.</p>
<p>Boot your OS.</p>

<h5>Generate your passphrase</h5>
<p>The best way I could came up to avoid the "weakest links" described above when generating a password is based on diceware.com. I modified it a bit and having a dice is optional.</p>

<p><a href="1296-sha512/index.html">First, print this page [optional depending on how paranoid you are]</a></p>

<h6>Now, if you have a dice:</h6>
<p>Throw it 4 times (let's say they came as 5-4-2-1). Now look at the table and see which word is 5421: "security".</p>
<p>Repeat that 23 times (so you will be throwing the dice 23*4 = 92 times) and write those 23 words down <strong>on a piece of paper</strong>.</p>

<h6>If you don't have a dice or don't wanna throw it 92 times:</h6>
<p>Type at least 100 "random" letters on your keyboard on the input field that can be found on the page above</p>
<p>This page will generate the SHA512 hash of what you typed and mark, in red, numbers 1-6 (as you'd get in a dice).</p>
<p>"But hey!", I can hear you asking, "what if this SHA512 is biased?!". Good question, young grasshopper! I won't be explaining how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" class="external">SHA512 works</a> here, but you can research by yourself that it's secure! But even then, I could have changed this specific implementation of SHA512 to not be secure, right?!</p>
<p>Yes! And one way you can verify I didn't is to type some stuff on that page and compare with other SHA512 implementations on other devices/pages.</p>
<p>You may still have reasons to be worried... in that case, just buy a dice!</p>

<h6>Now you have your passphrase</h6>
<p>Ok, so now you have a 23 words passphrase on paper.</p>
<p>Some people might want protection against fire/flooding/etc and engrave them on a steel sheet. If you're that kind of person, go ahead and do it, but just laminating it will probably be good enough; specially because you should have a backup somewhere else in any case - a steel sheet doesn't protect you against burglars or losing things.</p>
<p>Warning: Don't get creative with those words! Don't print them, don't backup them online. You should just use offline memory-less tools (pen, engraver, etc.)!</p>
<p>Now you also need a password that you will <b>not write down</b>. This will be useful to buy you some time in case your words get stolen, for instance.<br />If you are unsure if you're going to remember this password 5 years from now, write some kind of hint on your paper.</p>
<p>Now you should have something like <b>supply-initial-index-copper-can-long-few-enemy-try-submit-reduce-judge-camp-wing-two-sand-spread-dance-cost-food-assume-fat-cash<font style="color: gray">-MyRand0m!Pa55w0rdHere</font></b> and this will be your seed for the BIP32 generator!</p>

<font class="todo">
<p>Pending BIP32 wallet generator for multiple cryptocurrencies!</p>
<p>I found BIP39 ones that cover many: <a href="bip39/bip39-iancoleman/index.html">Here</a> and <a href="bip39/bip39-erasmospunk/index.html">here</a>
The first one allows a BIP32 root key to be input, but the second one (that supports more currencies) doesn't.<br />
I could hack it to allow the BIP32 key, but where else could people validate that it's working by comparing with other implementations?</p>

<p>To avoid data getting corrupted on the transfer, I set the error-correction level of the QR code to 15%. There's also a visual hash on the side of the encoder so you can compare if the data has the same image on both devices.</p></td>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>What if someone steals the pendrive that has my OS?</h4>
<p>In that case someone got lucky and got a nice bootable Linux distro! They could have downloaded it on their site if they wanted it that badly, but in any case, they get no coins.</p>
<p>On a serious note, I said before I'd assume the computer would be compromised and trying to save everything we did on internal storage (which could be this pendrive). That combined with someone robbing your pendrive and knowing how to access this data is not going to happen. But if you're concerned, you will need a non-writable CD instead of the pendrive (or you will need to destroy your pendrive and get a new one after everytime you use it). <font class="todo">any better suggestions?</font></p>
<h4>What if someone steals the air-gapped device?</h4>
<p>They got an air-gapped device, but it has no secret data in it!</p>
<p>Again, it could have something saved on an internal storage if you didn't remove its HDD/SDD. And again, that would require an extremely orchestrated attack.</p>
<h4>What if someone steals my 24-words?</h4>
<p>If you have a backup of your words and used a relatively strong passphrase, you're kinda safe. You're strongly encouraged to create new wallets and transfer your funds to them. Be careful not to lose your coins rushing to transfer them; there's no need to rush if you have a reasonably secure unwritten password.</p>

<h2>General thoughts</h2>
<p>When signing a transaction, always confirm it it's the same as you generated!</p>

<p>You don't need to download the desktop/cli wallets if you don't plan to make transactions soon (but it's recommended so you can test everything is working properly).</p>

<p>The derivation path contains an "external/internal" account. Set this to "1" if you wanna list the <b>change addresses</b> (ie, the address wallets send changes from your transaction if they are not made in the exact amount")</p>
